# wheather-predictor [WIP]

Predicts a likelyhood of a certain weather outcome based on days inputed (More days = hotter)

Currently takes the lower and upper clamp between a particular guess X, then calculates the difference and statistically suggests that a label associated to X1 or X2 is more likely to occur based on the training data WeatherTable provided. This is an algorithmic implementation aimed to replicate the rules (provided with at the match statement), without actually being fed those rules. The goal of this implementation is to give a better comparission against a real AI-implementation.
